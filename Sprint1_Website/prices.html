			<p> Our group recently played a game at ambush adventures in chobham recently, and we all agreed
			that the site itself was fantastic. It was quite different to what we were used to with ground zero,
			however the games were much faster paced with more action packed into each round due to the smaller
			playing field. Check out the website

			<p> Although herosharks masks have been around for a long time now, we thought we would mention how good they were.
			The masks fit comfortably, even around prescription glasses whilst providing excellent protection for both your eyes
			and your mouth if you choose a half face or full face variant. He also takes custom orders for any design you may have.
